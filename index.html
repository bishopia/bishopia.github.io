	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ian Bishop</h1>
	<p>I'm a postdoctoral research ecologist at the USGS Southwest Biological Science Center, 
		where I study how algal communities respond to 
		environmental change in the Glen Canyon reach of the Colorado River.
	<br>I'm based in Flagstaff, AZ.
	<br>What I share here is my own opinion and not endorsed by any organization.
