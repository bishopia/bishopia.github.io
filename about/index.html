        <h1>Ian Bishop, Ph.D.</h1>
        <p>I'm an algal ecologist interested in how algal communities inhabiting sensitive aquatic ecosystems respond to rapid environmental change. 
            I have a background in diatom ecology and systematics, for freshwater and marine taxa, using both molecular/bioinformatic and 
            microscopic/morphologic methods. I have published on topics as varied as the life history of the nuisance diatom <i>Didymosphenia geminata</i> 
            and polar pelagic diatom thermal physiology.
        </p>
        <p>I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Ecologist (USGS) at the Grand Canyon Research and Monitoring Center (GCMRC), where my research focuses 
            on long term trends in algal diversity and metabolism downstream of Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. In recent years, this cultural and 
            historically significant reach has experienced rapid changes in temperature and nutrient availability. Such change can have dramatic effects 
            on algal productivity at the base of the aquatic food webs and is of particular concern in food-limited, impounded ecosystems like 
            the Glen Canyon tailwaters.
        </p>
        <p>In additional to this work, I serve as an editorial review board member of the Diatoms of the North America website, where I attempt to help 
            other researchers acquire the diatom information they need in their own work. You can find more educational and professional details in 
            my CV above.
